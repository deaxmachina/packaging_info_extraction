# Extracting logos from product packaging with deep learning
- Side project done for Giki UK (Giki Social Enterprise Ltd).
- Collected photos of various logos on product packaging in UK supermarkets, such as "sustainable fishing", "certified organic" and "fair trade" certification logos. 
- The aim is to automatically detect these from the packaging and in a downstream step give information about the product based on them in order to aid the conscious consumer in making choices aligned with their values. 
- Currently trained CNN deep learning models with over 95% accuracy on the collected logo photos.
